Welcome to EJDB!
================

Mission
-------
EJDB is the embeddable (in-process) database engine designed for querying collections
of `JSON <http://json.org>`_ documents and persisting data.
EJDB is implemented as a C library based on `Tokyo Cabinet <http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/>`_
key-value storage engine. EJDB design is inspired by `Mongodb <http://mongodb.org>`_ and follows the same philosophy ,
especially for the :ref:`query language <ql>`

EJDB is good for:

* In-process database for standalone desktop applications. (The SQLite niche);
* Games development;
* Simple server-side solution;
* Whenever a fast in-process data-communication with storage layer is much preferred over TCP/IP transport;
